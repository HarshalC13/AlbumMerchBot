# AlbumMerchBot
Twitter bot that sends dm when an artist drops an album/video/merch (won't miss out on any limited merch drops anymore ðŸ˜¤  (looking at you travis scott) \
\ Likely want a server or something like that as it'll needed to remain running to catch any new posted tweets. \ \
Can also just send a dm with the links artists (or anyone technically) have in their bio, since artists usually put their album/merch links in their bio after they drop. \
