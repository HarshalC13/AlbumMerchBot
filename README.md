# AlbumMerchBot
Twitter bot that sends dm when an artist drops an album/video/merch \
Won't miss out on any limited merch drops anymore ðŸ˜¤  (looking at you travis scott) 

Better than keeping notifications on (since twitter doesn't have a notification filter) and getting spammed with every tweet these artists post.  \
Now only notifications you should get are for albums/merch and maybe music videos.

Likely want a server or something like that as it'll needed to remain running to catch any new posted tweets. 

Can also just send a dm with the links artists (or anyone technically) have in their bio, since artists usually put their album/merch links in their bio after they drop.
